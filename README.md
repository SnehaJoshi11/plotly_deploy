*A JavaScript and Plotly.js interactive dashboard*

## Project Overview

For this project we need to create interactive dashboard to demonstrate Belly Button Biodivercity. So that we can identify the top 10 bacterial species of belly button and that way we can identify Improbable Species of bacteria to manufacture Synthetic Beef.

## Purpose
Visualize the data for better understanding to draw some conclusions as reasearchers and data analysts.
The purpose of this research is to **gather, identify and analyze the biological data of individuals’ navels**.


## Requirements
The research holds data of 153 individuals and their: 
  -	Unique and anonyms ID.
  -	Demographic information.
  -	Belly button scrubbing frequency.
  -	Belly button biological footprint.

The individual can find one’s information by **selecting unique ID from a drop-down menu** and explore data by deep dive in their own results or compare the results to other individuals. **This research is also public and easily accessible**, so anyone can learn more about belly button biodiversity and explore this fascinating field. 

The interactive dashboard can be found in the link that follows and please feel free to try it on your own:

## Resources 
- JavaScript,Plotly.js
    - Advantage of **JavaScript** and **Plotly.js** library is that the audience doesn’t have to have any additional programs installed on their computers in order to *“run the code”*. JavaScript enables to create visualizations that are attractive, accessible and interactive.
    - The table is built by inserting **JavaScript** and **Plotly** into HTML page [charts.js](charts.js).
- Data
    - The data, stored in a json file [samples.json]( samples.json).

- HTML
    - To build the webpage [index.html](index.html).
- CSS and Bootstrap
    - To style the page [style.css](css/style.css)
- Chrome Developer Tools to test the code.
- GitHub
    - To deploy and showcase the final results [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://snehajoshi11.github.io/plotly_depoly/).
